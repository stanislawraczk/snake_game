    1. a simple menu: start game, quit...
    2. draw a game board and add randomly spawning fruit
    3. simple movement (up, down, left, right)
    4. simple collisions and finding the fruit (snake parts colliding 
       with themselves and snake hitting a wall)
    5. score tracking (will be especially needed to train the ai)
2. After first step is completed create an algorithm to steer the snake to
